# ðŸ“° Fake News Detection with RoBERTa + CNN-LSTM (FakeStack Replication)

> **Jupyter Notebook Project** â€” Binary classification of news articles (real vs fake) using **RoBERTa** embeddings + **CNN with skip connections** + **LSTM**. Built to replicate and extend the FakeStack architecture in a single, runnable notebook.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

- Re-implements the FakeStack approach in a **single Jupyter notebook**, swapping **BERT â†’ RoBERTa** for richer contextual embeddings.
- Architecture: **RoBERTa (Hugging Face)** â†’ **CNN (with skip connections)** â†’ **LSTM** â†’ **sigmoid classifier**.
- Training tricks: **weighted BCE loss** for class imbalance + **dynamic thresholding** to maximize F1.

## âš¡ Key Features

- **RoBERTa embeddings (`roberta-base`)** for contextual text representation.
- **CNN with skip connections** for local pattern extraction and feature reuse.
- **LSTM** for temporal/sequential dependencies.
- **Weighted BCEWithLogitsLoss** to handle class imbalance.
- **Dynamic threshold search** for best F1 (instead of fixed 0.5).
